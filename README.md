Write once, convert to multiple platforms.

O2 is a tool that converts your Obsidian markdown files to other markdown platforms such as Jekyll. 

But, currently, it only supports Jekyll. I will add more platforms in the future.
If you have any suggestions, please let me know.

## Prerequisites

### Directory structure of your vault

You should have a directory structure like this. (you can change the directory names)

```
Your vault
├── ready (when ready to publish, move your files to this directory)
├── published (when publish your files, they will be moved to this directory)
├── backlog (if the file is not ready or throw exception during convert process, it will be moved to this directory)
└── attachments (your attachments should be placed here)
```

Other directories will be ignored.

## Usage

If you want to convert your files, you should move them to the `ready` directory.

then, Execute the command `O2: converting` via obsidian's `cmd + p` shortcut.

### Limitations

- resource file name must not contain spaces
- backlog feature is not implemented yet

## Supported platforms

### Jekyll

- Chirpy
