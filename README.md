Write once, convert to multiple platforms.

O2 is a tool that converts your Obsidian Markdown files to other Markdown platforms such as Jekyll.

But, currently, it only supports Jekyll. I will add more platforms in the future.
If you have any suggestions, please let me know.

## Prerequisites

### Structure of your vault

You should have a folder structure like this. (of course, you can change the folder names in settings)

```text
Your vault
├── ready (where the notes you want to convert are placed)
├── backup (where the original notes before converting are placed)
└── attachments (where the attachments are placed)
```

Other Folders will be ignored.

## How to use

If you want to convert your notes, you should move them to the `ready` Folder.

then, Execute the command `O2: convert to Jekyll Chirpy` via obsidian's `cmd + p` shortcut.

if exception occurs, you can see the original note in the `backup` folder.
(I will implement transactional functionally in the future,
so that you can see the original note in the `ready` folder when exception occurs.)

## Supported platforms

### Jekyll Chirpy

#### Settings

```text
your jekyll project (ex: /Users/user1/Documents/GitHub/user1.github.io)
├── _posts (where the converted notes are placed)
└── assets
    └── img
        └── yyyy-MM-dd-title (where the attachments are placed. yyyy-MM-dd is replaced by the date of converting)
```

- jekyllPath is the path of your jekyll project (ex: /Users/user1/Documents/GitHub/user1.github.io).
- Attachments will be copied by the date under the `assets/img/<yyyy-MM-dd>` folder.
